      <p>The financial world is undergoing a significant transformation driven by innovation and 
        technology. This evolution is fueled by <i>FinTech</i>, short for <i>Financial Technology</i>.
        Initially, fintech focused on backend systems within established financial institutions (like banks). 
        However, from around 2018, there was a shift toward consumer-oriented services.
        Today, fintech spans various sectors, including education, retail banking, fundraising, investment management, and more. 
        It even involves cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. </p>

      <h2>What is FinTech?</h2>
      <p>FinTech refers to the use of technology to improve and automate the delivery of financial services.
         The fintech industry has witnessed remarkable growth over the past 
        decade, fueled by technological advancements and changing consumer behaviors. Startups and

         financial services. From mobile banking apps to blockchain-based solutions, fintech companies 
         are reshaping how we manage money, invest, and transact. Key areas of focus include peer-to-peer 
         lending, robo-advisors, payment gateways, and decentralized finance (DeFi). As the industry 
         continues to evolve, collaboration between traditional banks and fintech startups becomes 
         crucial
